I have established a habit of reading books lately, and I just wanted to maintain a list of books I've read. I'll sort it by category later on, but for now, I will just list them out.

# Completed

## I don't know when I read them list

- Made To Stick
- Extreme Ownership
- David and Goliath
- Rich Dad Poor Dad

- The Obstacle is the Way
- Disciplined Entrepreneurship
- Talking To Humans
- The Three Mistakes of My Life (it was one of my first books, so spare me some judgement on this one.)

The list excludes course books as well as programming books I've read.

# Reading/To-Read

## Currently Reading

- The Messy Middle
- Thinking Fast and Slow
- Freakonomics
- Hooked
- Blue Ocean Strategy
- The Wealth of Nations (I am not sure if I can complete it in a year)
- The Art of Logical Thinking

## Books in my shelf but have not even started

- A Song of Ice and Fire (the entire series)
- Dale Carnegie Book Collections
- This is Marketing
- The Godfather
- The Intelligent Investor
- The Personal MBA
- Switch
- The Art of War

The currently reading list has a lot of books, because I've found myself enjoying different books depending on what mood I am in that day. The simple switch in the habit has helped me maintain my attention span far more, so I think I'm going to stick with that for a while.

However, I think I have to make sure the list doesn't get any more longer. I will probably build a virtual stack for myself, where the maximum length is 5 or 6.
