I saw her in midst of a crowd
She smiled at me, I smiled back, For there was something unusual about the smile.
No one smiled at me before, No one even cared,
I was my mother’s worst- cooked food,
My father — he was a disappointed dude.
But today, she smiled again, I smiled back, For I didn’t know what else a man can really do,
I see a smile, and I return back the favor, She smiled again, but this time her effort
was more apparent, She wanted something ; but finding it out was above my intellect,

To her dismay, I smiled back again, Don’t Smile!

Do something I cry to myself,
While she was visibly distorted, probably wondered what this ugly man was up to,
I stood still, waiting for her in the corner of the assembly ,
“Don’t you get a hint?” She said to me with a scorn, “I do. When I see a smile, I smile back”. I say with one part of my heart torn.

See, it wasn’t arrogance from my side, it was just what I was taught,
Right from the childhood , the only smile I got was from my mother and a smile back really worked

Today though, it was different,
a girl wanted more from me, and suddenly minutes turned to hours,
We talked, we giggled, it looked like someone finally enjoyed my company,
I was newbie, I fumbled, I awkwardly shook hands, talked to her perhaps a little drunkenly,
I didn’t know anything for what I needed to do, but I knew I had to keep her by my side with all my powers,
A guy who got nothing in life had to keep a fairy without all odds at the top of his tower,
But alas, there was something fundamentally wrong about it,
For a fairy girl like her never suited a guy like me,
Karma it says never lets it happen,
Neither it was really a South Indian Movie,
Destiny is always right, I feared it but I had to be an exception ,
So I grabbed her and held her tight, I worked my ass off and calculate d every possible permutation,
But you know, I wasn’t a macho , and nor I had any charm,
The strength just got me nowhere and it wasn’t Even July when it was all gone without even an alarm.
She wanted me, she probably needed me,
But little did she know I loathed myself,
We were black and white, sugar and salt, Me a Shrek and she perhaps Princess Leia,
Her face reflected of a barbie doll, while I looked like a patient suffering from Gonorrhea

She had a million choices,
One so smart who could solve the String Theory, The other was dull but he could lift a tree, While I couldn’t even keep hold of my key.
Talking about keys, I was lost in her, never finding a door to the way out,
She was all I wanted, and irony is she was all I couldn’t get
To my surprise, a few other fairies did give me a second chance to life,
But ignorant I was, i never saw the bloom in the dark shadows; They gave me time, they gave me love, isn’t that all a person needs? But no.
That was all too overwhelming, Too much attention for my liking I felt.

With time, no one really waited, nor I really
ever gave them a chance,
While I waited for her in the same crowd with a hope for another dance,
But at the end, such is the misery of life,
The others weren’t here, nor was she All I had was I, but I loathed me
